OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

Coupling
Cohesion
Association
Aggregation
Composition
